## Quick Start

```
docker run -p 80:80 -p <managedurl_port>:8080 -p 9000:9000 \
            -e PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_HOST=<managedurl_host> \
            -e PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_PORT=<managedurl_port> \
            -e REDIS_HOST=<redis_host> \
            -e REDIS_PORT=<redis_port> \
            -e REDIS_PASS=<redis_pass> \
            openwhisk/apigateway:latest
```

(Optional) The redis password can be passed in encrypted using the `aes-256-cbc` encryption algorithm. To do so, pass in the following environment variables, in addition to the encrypted password:
- `DECRYPT_REDIS_PASS=true`
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32 Byte hex string that was used for encryption>`
- `ENCRYPTION_IV=<16 Byte hex string that was used for encryption>`

## Syncing configuration from a remote source

The Gateway can sync its configuration with a remote folder in the cloud such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, IBM Cloud Object Storage, Dropbox, and [many others](https://rclone.org/). The configuration is monitored for changes, and when a file is changed, the Gateway is reloaded automatically. This is very useful to gracefully update the Gateway on the fly, without impacting the active traffic; if the new configuration is invalid, the Gateway doesn't break, running with the last known valid configuration.

This feature is enabled by configuring a few environment variables:
* `REMOTE_CONFIG` - the location where the configuration should be synced from. I.e. `s3://api-gateway-config` . The remote location is synced into is `/etc/api-gateway`.
The default configuration is found in this project's root folder.
* (optional) `REMOTE_CONFIG_SYNC_INTERVAL` - how often to check for changes in the remote location. The default value is `10s`
* (optional) `REMOTE_CONFIG_RELOAD_CMD` - which command to execute in order to reload the Gateway. The default value is: `api-gateway -s reload`

Syncing is done through [rclone sync](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/). `rclone` has a rich set of [options](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_sync/) such as what to exclude when syncing, or what to include. An important configuration is `--config`, pointing to the config file in `/root/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`. The Gateway should be started with `/root/.config/rclone` folder mounted so that `rclone.conf` is present.  To generate a new `rclone` configuration simply execute:

```
docker run -ti --rm --entrypoint=rclone -v `pwd`/rclone/:/root/.config/rclone/ openwhisk/apigateway config
```

This runs an interactive `rclone config` command and stores the resulted configuration in `./rclone/rclone.conf` file.

To test this locally, _simulate_ a remote folder using a local location, by mounting it in `/tmp` folder as follows:

```bash
docker run -ti --rm -p 80:80 \
    -v `pwd`:/tmp/api-gateway-local -e REMOTE_CONFIG="/tmp/api-gateway-local" \
    -e REDIS_HOST=redis_host -e REDIS_PORT=redis_port openwhisk/apigateway
```
Then make changes to any configuration file ( i.e. `api-gateway.conf` ), save it, then watch as the Gateway reloads the updated configuration automatically.

## Developer Guide

### Running locally

 To build the docker image locally use:
 ```
  make docker
 ```

 To Run the Docker image
 ```
  make docker-run PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_HOST=<mangedurl_host> PUBLIC_MANAGEDURL_PORT=<managedurl_port> \
    REDIS_HOST=<redis_host> REDIS_PORT=<redis_port> REDIS_PASS=<redis_pass>
 ```


### Testing

 To build the test image and run unit tests
 ```
  make test
 ```
